# Is it possible to graddually port our code ?
- our code is originally based for three.js editor
- we need to change adapt the modification we made to the .json format
  - especially how we handle files
- all threex originally worked without designer
- gradual port is better as than an all in one, big refactor. it is less likely to endup badly
  - is it possible in this case
